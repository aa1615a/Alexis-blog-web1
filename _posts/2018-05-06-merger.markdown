### Justice department is right to be wary of a major merger by phone companies


In recent years, many major companies have been consolidating, but that creates dangerous monopolies and drastically reduces economic competition. Without competition consumers can be trapped by few companies making unfair policies that everyone has to put up with since they are the only option. I think being cautious and looking into all of the consequences of the merger is important. Consumers have to be protected first even if thats not what the company has in mind.
