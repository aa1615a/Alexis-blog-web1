## New York Times Open


My news design class visited the New York Times earlier this semester. They talked to us about the changes they're making in their newsroom to develop code that all of their writers can use. They've been very open about the process and actaully make their code available for others to use. Here is the section of their site where they publish updates on what they have been doing around the newsroom.
