I was looking through the AU graphic design page to make sure I am on track with my minor requirements. (I really want to take GDES-405 Experience Design). I saw this cute interview with the AU design club leaders. I picked GDES as minor at first because I thought it would be the most useful thing that would compliment my digital jouralism, but I've learned to be really creative and have a lot of fun with it. I've really grown to love graphic design over the last two semesters and I hope I can start making awesome stuff once I learn a lot more.
