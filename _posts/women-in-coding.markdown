## This company is doing pretty cool stuff  

Revolut realized that they don't have a lot of gender diversity in its engineering team, but this is an issue within the industry overall, so they decided to do something about it. With a valuation at a billion dollars they could have plenty of people clamoring to work there, but they still decided to offer classes for free. I think its really awesome that they are trying to make the space a more welcoming place.
